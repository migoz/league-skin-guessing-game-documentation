## Introduction

This documentation aims to clarify the project structure and general implementation strategy used in the <a href="https://github.com/Orkidz/league-of-legends-guessing-game" target="_blank">League of Legends Skin Guessing Game</a> (you can check out the live demo <a href="https://kanekigames.com/league-skin-guessing-game/" target="_blank">here</a>).

## Overview

League of Legends is a hugely popular MOBA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena" target="_blank">Multiplayer online battle arena</a>) game which arguably has pioneered Esports in the western hemisphere and led the path for other games to follow suit. It's also my personal passion, of which I've devoted an amount of time to I'm a little embarassed to admit ðŸ˜„. Though the game is free to download and play, its developer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_Games" target="_blank">Riot Games</a> (or, simply, Riot) has chosen a business model in which it encourages users to optionally pay for cosmetic changes to characters they play via microtransactions. Over time, Riot has created over a thousand different skins for their enourmous roster of champions a player can choose from. Interestingly, Riot doesn't divide these skins evenly for each champion. In fact, some may have more than 10 skins, while others have just one. One can assume this is done purposely as, generally speaking, the more popular champions tend to have more skins, which obviously means more money for Riot.

With all of that said, this sparked a simple idea where a user will be repeatedly presented with 2 randomly selected champions and have to select which of the two they believe currently has more skins in game. While seemingly easy at a glance, this game is actually pretty difficult due to the sheer number of champions that exist in the game, many of which a typical user will have never actually even played. Though simple in nature, the game is fun and possibly even addictive as the user's highest score is always recorded for them to boast about and share with their friends.

Future plans for this is to incorporate a live leaderboard as well as an all time leaderboard so legends of the game can be remembered for their League of Legends skin count prowess. If you have any suggestions or ideas on how to further improve upon the game, feel free to reach out or share your idea on the repository. Enjoy!
